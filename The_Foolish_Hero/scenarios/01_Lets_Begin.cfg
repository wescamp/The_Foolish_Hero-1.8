    story=_"Once upon a time in a land called Wesnoth, far far, away, since the last gate was closed, lived a knight named Dendrian the Fool. Why he was called 'the fool' was, rather obvious, though stout of heart and brave was for sure. Surely, people said, that there was no stronger swordsman in all the land! And while young soldiers admired him, (when no was there to mock him) other knights and lords scoffed. 'surely there is more to a knight than his sword!' they said to each other. What Sir Dendrian thought about how people treated him, he never said."

    story=_"When his father died on an journey to the north, people looked to the brawny yet thickskulled son to step up and fill his place at the Order of Isar; a group of Men and Elves that wandered the land in search of adventure and enemies of the crown. His Father had been a questing sort, and rarely paid much attention to the estate. Though the peasants never were harmed by any attack, they grumbled that their lord neglected all but the taxes. So when Dendrian became master of the house, things were in great disrepair. The other members of the council were all respected and powerful men, seeing this foolish youth in their presence was a disgrace, they said. They smirked at his puny and abandoned estate, his lack of knowledge, even his accent, but he never said anything, and simply puttered about for twenty years. "

    story=_" Nothing ever  exciting happened for him, and people never really thought much of anything that happened up in that wild part of Wesnoth. So I will tell you how this fool happend to change the land, when the generals, kings, and wizards couldn't. It really is a simple one, that happened to a simple person, but for some reason, all the wise and clever people never understood how, or why he did it. I think I know why, so I will tell you."

    story=_" It was a sunny day in early summer, and all the birds were singing. He lived alone on the estate with a handful of servants and a boy whom he called his squire. In truth the boy was a son of a rich family who thought somehow the call of a squire would be healthy for his character, and Sir Dendrian was the only person foolish enough to take him. "
