Just kidding, here is the life advice: It is common habit in modern vampires to eat a human every time that person calls them fat. Don't. If you do, you simply are accepting defeat, and eating in one swift stroke. 
Instead, restrain yourself from eating people, so that the next time you see that fellow, you will have something to prove.  "

Depressed vampires may be firm dieters, but they still somehow keep gaining weight. So what ever you do, don't be depressed about your weight, be happy and hopeful! Never take your eyes off your goal, or they will start drifting towards the mirror. Here is some things that cause depression: Friends: Do your friends all seem better than you, despise you, or don't seem to understand? Chuck them, vampires were meant to be loners anyway.
Do you feel that you miss the bustle of humanity? Instead of walking the streets after dark and sobbing your head off, buy an overcoat and a hat, and try to get a job in the day time! Yes, that last comment was a little radical, but here is one that will really make a difference: Do you feel that blood is your only friend? That you just can't get used to nothing to do in the daytime? Cheer up your lair with some pets, Vampire bats make good home security as well as give you some one to love!   "

			message= _ "(It appears that most of pages have been torn out. A few still remain though) Necromancy definitely goes well with the emo surroundings of a vampire, but often one may forget three important things about undead: A: your minions are just like you, and can not abide anything that is holy or good. Never, never invade a church with them. You, and your minions will be reduced to dust. B: Their fragile bodies can't stand crushing things. Don't even think about taking them to an event with HI of Footpads. Sometimes it might just go over their heads, but there is a good chance the event will make an impact.  C: Careful what you say. Even if a ghost is your minion, making fun of its hair style might cost you your unlife."

What does this mean? If ever we must fight one, I think I have learned enough about their bodies. They cannot stand heavy impact to their bones, perhaps because they posses bones empty like birds?
