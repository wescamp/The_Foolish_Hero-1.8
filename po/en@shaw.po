"gate was closed, lived a knight named Dendrian the Fool. Why he was called "
"'the fool' was, rather obvious, though stout of heart and brave was for "

"land! And while young soldiers admired him, (when no was there to mock him) "

"When his father died on an journey to the north, people looked to the brawny "

"group of Men and Elves that wandered the land in search of adventure and "
"enemies of the crown. His Father had been a questing sort, and rarely paid "
"much attention to the estate. Though the peasants never were harmed by any "
"attack, they grumbled that their lord neglected all but the taxes. So when "
"Dendrian became master of the house, things were in great disrepair. The "
"other members of the council were all respected and powerful men, seeing "
